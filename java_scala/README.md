# Intent HQ Java/Scala Code Challenges

If you are a candidate and are doing one (or more) of this small katas at home you may want to read this.

There are different katas in the package `com.intenthq.challenge`, each of them consists of a single file: `SKataName` (if scala) or `JKataName` (if java).

Each challenge comes with a set of tests written in specs2, you won't probably need to add any test, but in case you need to, you'll find documentation about the test framework in here: http://specs2.org/

## How to start

1. Read all the challenges and chose the one(s) you like best
2. Download this folder or clone the repo **without creating a fork** and start working on it.
3. Push your changes and send us the link to the github repo
